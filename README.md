# 🌱 Hydro Harvest


**Hydro Harvest** is a powerful tool designed to empower farmers by providing insights into water-related challenges. Utilizing NASA datasets, our application allows farmers to explore, analyze, and utilize valuable data to improve farming practices, manage water resources efficiently, and increase crop yield.

## 📥 How to Download and Use

1. Download the project by cloning the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd HydroHarvest`.
3. After building, locate the executable by going to the following path:
   ```
   BRACU-NASA-PROJ/bin/Debug/net6.0-windows/
   ```
4. Run the application by executing `BRACU-NASA-PROJ.exe`.


## 🌐 Machine Learning & Dataset API

The **HydroHarvest** project also integrates a powerful machine learning model and dataset API, developed by one of our team members. This component allows us to analyze and predict water requirements, crop irrigation needs, and other key factors that contribute to smarter farming decisions. 

For more details on the API and machine learning model, please visit the separate repository [here](https://github.com/SucksToBeAnik/hydroharvest).


### Requirements:
- **.NET 6.0 Framework** must be installed on your machine.
- The application is built for **Windows operating systems** only.

## 🚜 Problem Statement

Farmers face a deluge of water-related challenges, including:

- **Unpredictable Weather**: Droughts and floods can strike unexpectedly, leading to significant crop loss.
- **Pests & Diseases**: Water scarcity or excess can create favorable conditions for pests and diseases, affecting crop health.
- **Economic Impact**: Inefficient water management can lead to reduced profits and food security.

With Hydro Harvest, farmers can make informed decisions based on real-time data and predictions, enabling them to tackle these challenges head-on.

## 📊 Features

- **Precise Precipitation Data**: Get accurate rainfall predictions for your geographical location using an intuitive map interface.
- **Irrigation Water Requirement (IWR) Calculator**: Calculate the optimal water needs for your crops based on their type and growth stage.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A modern and simple design allows farmers to navigate the tool effortlessly.
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Present crucial data in clear tables, engaging charts and **Visualizing Calendar** for better understanding.

## 🧑‍🌾 How It Works

1. **Input Section**:  
   - Enter your **land size** (length and width).
   - Specify your **location** using a map integration.
   - Choose the **year** and **radius** for precipitation data.
  
2. **Output Section**:  
   - View the **precipitation data** in a table format.
   - Analyze the data visually with **bar charts** showing rainfall trends.
   - Calculate the **Irrigation Water Requirement** tailored to your selected crops.
